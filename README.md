# AzureSecureWebAppProject
Students will build, secure, and protect a cloud application that hosts their own cyber blog. This project will result in tangible deliverables that demonstrate their knowledge of cloud, cloud security, networking, web development, cryptography, and network security.

## Module Objectives
  
**Day 1**: Students will build, host, and design their own web application. This day will incorporate topics from the Networking, Cloud, and Web Development modules.



**Day 2**: Students will secure their web application with SSL certificates. This day will incorporate topics from the Cryptography and Terminal modules.



**Day 3**: Students will protect their web application with Azure's security features. This day will incorporate topics from the Network Security module.

## Lab Environment
For the majority of demonstrations and activities, the class will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal. You will not use any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will use personal Azure accounts.


## What to Be Aware of:

Students can choose to work independently or work in groups, but students are required to remain in class (online or in person).
Each day builds on the previous day to complete the project, and each day's activities must be completed in order.
Students will have two choices for selecting the domain for their website. The choices are based on the cost they are willing to spend.

Based on the student choice, they will follow specific project instructions in each project day.


If students purchase a domain, they can elect to cancel their domain for a full refund if they cancel their domain within 5 days of ordering.
